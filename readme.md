# ThreeJS with Vite Starter Pack

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

Once you've cloned or downloaded this project to your local machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

'npm install'


### Running the project

To start the development server, run the following command:

'npm run dev'

This will start the server and open your default browser to your localhost. The site will reload automatically as you make changes to your code.

That's what it should look like in the browser:

The project isn't perfect, unfortunately there are bugs and the character sometimes drops below the surface. Also the distance from portals isn't calculated perfectly and detection doesn't work as intended resulting in showing example portfolio popup at improper times.

However I'm still quite happy with the result and the skills I've gained.
Everything is based on the Vite starter pack as it's a lightweight and simple solution.
I've used THREE.JS library to create the world.
Then I implemented physics with use of Rapier engine.
Finally, I've modeled the scene in Blender, dropped it into my THREE.JS world.
